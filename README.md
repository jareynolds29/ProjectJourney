# Project Journey

This is the start of my Journey learning C++ and become a Game Developer/Programmer.


## Lessons Learned

Within this project I learned about the main function used in C++ and how to Include
libraries and access their functions. In this project I accessed the cstdio library and
used the printf(); function to give you some information about myself within the terminal.

I also learned a bit about the compiler and debugging whilst learning these basics.
